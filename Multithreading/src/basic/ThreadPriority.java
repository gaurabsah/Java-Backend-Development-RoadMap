/*
If we are commenting line 1 then both main and child Threads will have the
same priority and hence we can't expect exact execution order.
ï‚· If we are not commenting line 1 then child Thread has the priority 10 and main
Thread has the priority 5 hence child Thread will get chance for execution and
after completing child Thread main Thread will get the chance in this the output
is:


Some operating systems(like windowsXP) may not provide proper support for Thread
priorities. We have to install separate bats provided by vendor to provide support for
priorities
